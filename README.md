Numerical Methods for Computer Science
============

Collection of Matlab algorithms implemented by me that carry out different matrix operations.
This was a project for the Numerical Methods for Computer Science course in my senior year of my BSc in computer science at UDC (Spain).


## Gauss-Seidel Morse stored
Gauss-Seidel implementation for morse storage matrices. The method is used to solve a linear system of equations.

## LU Decomposition
LU decomposition that factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular one. This can be used to solve linear systems of equations.

## Cholesky Factorization Profile stored 
Cholesky decomposition of a profile stored sparse matrix into a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. Used to solve linear systems of equations. 

## Power Iteration Method Morse stored
Implementation of the power method for calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a matrix stored in morse.

## Tools

The project was developed with Matlab.
